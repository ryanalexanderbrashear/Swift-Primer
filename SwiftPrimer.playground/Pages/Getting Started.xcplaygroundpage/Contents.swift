 # Swift Primer 4.0
 
 ## Setup
 
 * Your Mac - Hopefully relatively recent
 * Running High Sierra
 * Xcode 9, the most recent version so we can use Swift 4.0
 * Git
 
 ## Swift and Programs
 
 **What is a program?**  It's simply a set of instructions written in a computer language. It's simply a set of instructions written in a computer language that will be interpreted or compiled into machine code to be executed by the computer.
 
 **Why on earth would I learn another language?**
 * What is Swift used for?
 * What makes Swift different from other languages?
 * Will I ever use it again?
 
 The language that we're going to work on is Swift, which is Apple's latest high level language that is used for the creation of applications written for iOS, the Mac OS, and the Apple TV.
 
 **What's a compiler?**.  When we write programs in a "high level language", the compiler is a special program that takes the source code we have written and translates it into a language that is more efficiently run by the target device.
 
 Xcode has a compiler built into it, amongst a few other things
 * A compiler
 * An editor
 * A debugger
 * And a bunch of other tools
 * That make's it an IDE
 

 
 ## Playgrounds
 
 A playground is an interactive coding environment created in Xcode that evaluates each statement within Xcode and displays the results as updates are made.
 
 Using a playground is a quick way to type in and prototype code without the need to create an entire Xcode project, and layout screens.  It does have some limitations as the code runs slower and there really isn't a debugger, but for simple classes and prototype code it does the trick.
 
 For the most part, the instructions that you'll see written in these playgrounds are executed top to bottom.  It's a little different once we get outside of the playground, but this will keep things simple for learning.
 
 Let's take a look at the IDE....
