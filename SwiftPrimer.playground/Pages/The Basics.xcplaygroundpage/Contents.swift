 # The Basics
 
 Just to get going, we'll need a to know how things work in a Playground...
 
 ### First - This is a Playground
 
 * There is a special language called markdown that I am using to write this text, but it is just text, and it's useful for adding documentation to a Playground.
 * Also - There is code!  You can see the code, it's where the line numbers are.
*/
// Technically, this comment is considered a line of code, but it is ignored by the compiler
/*:
 ### Second - Parts of the Playground
 * To the left are the Navigators
 * To the immediate right (in the gray area) is the results sidebar
 * To the far right are the Utilities
 * Below is the Debug Area
 * You can access the various area using the three panel control buttons in the top right
*/
/*:
 ### A Few Samples
 * A comment
 * A variable
 * A print statement
 * Running the Playground
 */
// First comment <- This is a comment

// A variable
var text: String = "All work and no play makes Devan a dull boy."       // Check out the debug area -->

// A few print statements
print("This is a test")                                                // Check out the debug area again! -->
print(text)
/*:
 ### Run
 
 Run the Playground using the run button below, and watch the results sidebar and the debug area
